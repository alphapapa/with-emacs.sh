This script makes it easy to run Emacs with alternative configurations (i.e. not =~/.emacs.d=).  For example, to run Emacs with a configuration stored in =~/new-emacs.d=, simply run:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ with-emacs.sh --dir ~/new-emacs.d
#+END_SRC

It can also use temporary, "sandbox" directories that are automatically created and then removed after Emacs exits: just run =with-emacs.sh= without specifying a directory.

It's helpful for developing packages, troubleshooting configuration problems, trying out alternative configurations, etc.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  with-emacs.sh [OPTIONS] [EMACS-ARGS]

  Run Emacs with a specified configuration directory.  If no directory
  is specified, a temporary one is made with "mktemp -d" and removed
  when Emacs exits.

  Options
    --debug     Show debug information and don't remove temp directory.
    -h, --help  This.
    --          Optionally used to separate script arguments from
                Emacs arguments.

    -d, --dir   DIR            Use DIR as user-emacs-directory.
    -e, --emacs PATH           Run Emacs executable at PATH.

    -i, --install PACKAGE      Install PACKAGE.
    -O, --no-org-repo          Don't use the orgmode.org ELPA repo.
    -P, --no-package           Don't initialize the package system.
    -R, --no-refresh-packages  Don't refresh package lists.

Inspired by and some code copied from [[https://github.com/melpa/melpa][MELPA]]'s Makefile.

* Alternatives

+  [[https://github.com/plexus/chemacs2][Chemacs2]] is a system of three Elisp files designed to replace your =~/.emacs.d= and switch between "profiles" stored in other directories.  It requires a configuration file pointing to the profiles' directories.  It offers some additional functionality, like setting environment variables per-profile.
     -  In contrast, =with-emacs.sh= does not replace anything, and it requires no configuration; just run it with a directory of your choice.  It's just a Bash script, so if you want to set an environment variable, use standard tools, like =env=.
